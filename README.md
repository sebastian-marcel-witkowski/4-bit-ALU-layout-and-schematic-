# 4-bit-ALU-layout-and-schematic-
This was a final project for my VLSI design course where we were asked to design a 4-bit arithmetic logic unit that would implement 
addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, and bitwise XOR. I've included the project description "project.pdf" and layouts/schematics of all components in addition to the final design itself.
