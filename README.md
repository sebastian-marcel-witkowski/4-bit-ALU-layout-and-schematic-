# 4-bit-ALU-layout-and-schematic-
This was a final project for my VLSI design course where we were asked to design a 4-bit arithmetic logic unit that would implement 
addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, and bitwise XOR. I've included layouts and schematics of all components in addition to the final 
design.
